1   1   2    3    5   8 …..   
2.	Write a program to print factorial of N. (Using class fact)
3.	Build a class person, which contains person name, age and city as data members and member functions getdata( ) and printdata ( ).  Write a C++ program to read and display a person data.
4.	Define a class student, which accept student number, name and marks of three subjects. Calculate total and percentage using different member functions. (For single student only)
Output:

[ii] void sort_desc() : to sort an array in descending order.
Write menu driven program for sorting either ascending or descending order and also for exit from a program.
6.	Write a C++ program to build a class String and write down the following member functions for string manipulation.
 [i]. strlen1() : To count the length of the string.
[ii]. strcpy1() : To copy one string to another.
[iii]. strcat1() : To combine two string into one. 
[iv]. strcmp1() : To compare two string.
